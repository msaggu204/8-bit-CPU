# 8-bit-CPU

ðŸ§  Project: 8-Bit CPU Design in VHDL

Designed and implemented a simple 8-bit CPU on a Zybo Z7-10 board using VHDL. The CPU followed a controller-datapath architecture, with a structurally composed datapath and a finite state machine (FSM)-based controller to fetch, decode, and execute instructions. Custom instructions like NOT and JMPR were added beyond the standard instruction set. Each component was tested individually and then integrated into a top-level system with a keypad and 7-segment display for user interaction and real-time output visualization.
